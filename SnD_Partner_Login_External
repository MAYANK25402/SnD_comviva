For Partner login into the product or the main file we will do the following things

1. All the partner can login using the Blue Marble Retail System itself, the main thing the user must be created using the rule mentioned in the org's creiteria.

For the External USer login we use the set of the rules to allow access of the main portal.

There are set of rule /TEST CASES like the mannual testing which will be followed to create the external user

--------> first the DMS will ask for the username to enter for the user login

--------> if the name is valid or contains no special characters then user will hit enter

--------> if all the credentials are correct then use will be directed to the next step or else user will be thrown out by getting message invalid credentials

--------> once all the credentials are correct then user will be asked to give the password according to it's choice

--------> same goes for the passworrd also if all the credentials are good the we are good to go otherwise it will through the same error

--------> if the password is correct then a OTP will be sent to the user's phone no. [not mail it is still not created] 

--------> now user have to give type that OTP in the assigned region and the same process will be followed like username and the password process
