We have created the external partner now we will create the Internal Partner usin the same process 

--------> It will follow the same procedure like the external user creation 

--------> first it will ask for the same username and the password from the new user login or signup

--------> if all the credentials are correct the it will be diverted to the next procedure

--------> now DMS will send the username and the password details to the LDAP system via the Rest API

--------> LDAP system internally verifies the username details and the password in the internal system

--------> if the successfull login confiremed by the LDAP system the it will provide the Rest API with the success

--------> if the login was not successfull the the LDAP system will provide the Rest API with the message of the actual failure of the messsage to it
